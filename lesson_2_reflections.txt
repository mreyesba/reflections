What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

you create a .git.txt file that tracks your project files. You need it because otherwise you can not use git commands for that repository which makes git useless

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is related directly to a commit the working directory is essecially the folder you are working on, so they are pretty different things. It is a very usefull tool because it helps you to indicate which files have been modified in a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

you can compare the staging area with the last commit in your repository to be sure what exactly are you commenting
