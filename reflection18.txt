Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think it is because Git, for example, is used to manage coding projects which sometimes have multiple files interrelated, in the other hand, Google Docs is used to store multiple files that rarely have two do with each other.
