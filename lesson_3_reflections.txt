When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you work in multiple computers or if you share the project with other people, keeping your project in a remote repositoy might be a 
pretty good idea.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because maybe there are changes that are not worth it to save due to their size or importance. It's important to have that flexibility.
